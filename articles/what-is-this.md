This is a modern, serverless, and lightweight catalog solution optimized for maximum speed and zero maintenance. 

Instead of relying on a traditional, heavy server-side database, this entire knowledge base is constructed from static files (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, and Markdown).

#### How It Works Behind the Scenes:
1. **The Frontend** fetches a lightweight search index (`index.json`) immediately upon loading.
2. **The Search Engine** executes entirely within your browser. Every keystroke sorts and filters the index in a split second.
3. **The Content** is loaded completely on-demand. Only when you click a specific card does JavaScript fetch that specific Markdown file and convert it to HTML.

> **Key Benefit:** Because the website strictly contains static assets, it is 100% free to host on platforms like GitHub Pages, immune to database-injection attacks, and can withstand infinite traffic without dropping in performance.
